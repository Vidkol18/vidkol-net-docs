# Lesson 10 - ITS AN ASSIGNMENT.

## Values and Variable

1. Declare variable called `country`, `continent` `population` and assign their values to your own country (populations in millions).
2. Log their values to the console.

What I did:

```js
let country = "United Kingdom";
let continent = "Europe";
let population = "69.5 Million";

let finalString = `Country: ${country}, Continent: ${continent}, Population: ${population}`;
console.log(finalString);
```
