# Lesson 7 - A Brief Introduction to JavaScript

**What is JavaScript?** A high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language.

**What is the role of JavaScript in Web Development?** 3 Things make up a website. HTML, CSS and JavaScript. All these things work together to make a beautiful, interactive and dynamic website.

- HTML: the _content_ on the page (text, buttons, images etc).
- CSS: the _presentation_ styling and layout of the elements on the page.
- JavaScript: allows the developer to add dynamic and interactive effects to any web page. Also use it to manipulate the content or css, load data from remote servers and build entire applications in the browser (Web Applications).

React, Angular and VUE are JavaScript Frameworks and should **_NOT_** be used until I am good at JavaScript.

ES6/ES2015+ modern JavaScript.
